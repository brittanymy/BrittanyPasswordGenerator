# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some [examples of special characters on the OWASP Foundation website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

MY README COMMENTS

Script contains proper functions and variables to successfully generate a password for the user based off of selected prompts. 

Global functions allow web browser to generate random numbers using a minimum and maximum parameter. 

Selected prompts can include random numbers, symbols, lowercase, or uppercase letters. 

If user decides to cancel their character length selection, they will be given the option to exit the prompt. 

Selecting 'cancel' during prompted questions will not give the user those canceled selections. 

Using console.log, the web browser gives the user a list of questions to guide them through the prompt. 

Setting a return value at the end of the function allows generated password to display through html.
